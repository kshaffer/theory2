<a href="/img/twitterBio.jpg"><img src="/img/twitterBio-small.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 12px" alt="bio picture of Kris Shaffer, Ph.D."/></a>Welcome to the second semester of the music theory sequence at CU–Boulder! I'm looking forward to getting to know you all more as we dive into a variety of musics in greater detail!

We'll be starting our weeks together, meeting Monday and Wednesday mornings at 8am, in room C199.

In this course, we will be pursuing the following goals:

- increased *fluency* in a larger variety of musical concepts  
- *connection* of those basic concepts to music from a multiplicity of styles – specifically classical instrumental music and pop/rock music  
- experience *building* musical structures, such as melodies and phrases  
- experience *breaking* musical structures apart, and possibly *re-building* them, in order to understand them better  
- the ability to *ask good questions* about musical structure and meaning  
- *critical mindfulness* – which techniques belong to which styles, which methods of building and breaking are appropriate for which pieces of music, etc.

As in our work last semester, these goals are about *you* and *your* growth as musicians. The work of dead (or living) celebrities like Beethoven, Beyoncé, the Bangles, and The Beatles is not at the center of what we will do. Nor will my activity as the instructor be at the center of what we do. *Your* work will be at the center of class. I will design activities to support that work and guide you through it, I will choose (or write) materials to support that work, and we will together choose much of the repertoire through which we will work. But it is you and your musical/intellectual/personal growth that will be at the center of what we do.

Of course, there's more than one of you, and we will do much of this work together. In order for that to work, we need to create an environment of mutual respect and inclusion, where we are all safe to try new things and float new ideas, as well as to challenge those ideas. I have done my best to accomodate different personality types, different study preferences, and lots of opportunities to try something out without worrying about a grade penalty in the way that I have designed assessments and class activities. However, creating an environment in which all feel respected, feel free to speak their mind and live their identity, is a responsibility we all must take on — both individually and collectively. Let's all commit to doing what we can to create an inclusive, mutually supportive environment, and please feel free to come to me if you feel that is not happening in the ways that it could (or should).

Unlike last semester, I will not begin the course with you. I will be on parental leave for the first five and a half weeks. Karin Buer will be taking my place until I return. She is a graduate student at the University of Northern Colorado and holds a Masters degree in music theory from CU–Boulder. I have been in contact with her, sharing materials and communicating course goals, so I have every confidence that you are in good hands. She is also in contact with Yonatan Malin, who is coordinating Aural Skills 2, so she knows what you are working on in your aural skills sections. We're doing everything we can to ensure a smooth transition, as well as to ensure that you have what you need to grow in your musicianship.

I'm looking forward to seeing you again when I return. We have some great music to make — and break — together!
