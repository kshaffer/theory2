## Exercise

For the following two phrase-length excerpts (one unfigured bass line, one melodic fragment), complete the excerpt with a full four-voice melodic keyboard-style texture. In the Trinket models, also include a Roman numeral/figured bass analyis using the lyric tool. As you work, also keep track of the following elements on a piece of paper, which we will discuss together.

- T/PD/D functions  
- phrase-ending cadence  
- the cadential progression  
- the prolongation type of any non-tonic chords you use in the tonic zone preceding the cadential progression

Keeping track of these things will help ensure that you are following the *phrase model* (the standard harmonic model for a typical classical phrase) in your excerpt.

## Procedure

The following procedure is by no means the only way to realize an unfigured bass or harmonize a melody according to the phrase model, but it can be a helpful guide to starting out.

1. Open any materials from [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com/contents) that may be helpful in tabs in your web browser. Consult them regularly as you work to apply those concepts.  
2. Find the best/only location for a cadential progression. Label the chords and/or provide bass notes. If there are multiple options for a chord, *keep track of all of them now* and choose the best one once you have the rest of the music outlined.  
3. In the music that precedes the cadential progression, find some easy places to include straightforward tonic-prolongation schemas (a passing 6/4 chord, a neighbor chord, etc.), and insert Roman numerals and/or bass notes.  
4. If any chords remain undecided, work out harmonic solutions for those chords, using the existing chords as guides and keeping in mind that all pre-cadential-progression chords should either be tonic function or part of a well-formed tonic-prolongation pattern. These chords may belong to more complex patterns like *subsidiary harmonic progressions*, *deceptive resolutions*, harmonic sequences, or involve applied-dominant chords.  
5. Work out the voice leading (melody first, if you are realizing an unfigured bass; bass-first, if you are harmonizing a melody).  
6. Work out final chord decisions as you compose the inner voices. (For example, decisions between IV and ii<sup>6</sup>, V<sup>6/5</sup>/x or vii°<sup>7</sup>/x, etc. are often best made in light of which option makes the smoothest voice-leading.)  
7. Play and/or listen to your excerpt, and make adjustments as your ears, eyes, and hands notice issues.


## Model solutions

You may find my model solutions here: [unfigured bass](https://trinket.io/music/892e0196a7) | [melody](https://trinket.io/music/bbc1c75140)

Which do you think provides more compositional freedom while still matching stylistic norms, the unfigured bass realization or the melody harmonization?
