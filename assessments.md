## Grades (from the syllabus)

The most important and interesting aspects of learning are things that are difficult to assess fairly and reductively (i.e., with a single letter). As a result, heavy emphasis on grades tends to [undermine alternative perspectives](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/)—the exact opposite of what a liberal education should do.

My goal in grading is three-fold: to diminish the significance and the negative impact grades can have on the learning environment, to direct your studies clearly (but flexibly) to specific areas that need attention, and to make sure that grades do carry some meaningful representation of the knowledge and skills you possess and gain by the end of the course.

With that in mind, assessment will be oriented around specific concepts and skills, and in order to facilitate learing, the bulk of the assessments will either allow collaboration or reassessment, if not passed on the first attempt. All assessments within a category will be weighted equally.

I have done my best to keep the assessment simple. However, when questions and confusions inevitably arise, it is your responsibility to talk to me as soon as you can so that we can straighten things out.


### Final grade calculation

Following are assessment types that comprise the final grade:

- **Reading/video quizzes (online)** - 20% of the final grade.  
- **Fundamentals quizzes (online)** - 20% of the final grade.  
- **Fundamentals test** - 10% of the final grade.  
- **Application assignments** - 40% of the final grade.  
- **Final writing project** - 10% of the final grade.

Below are written and/or video descriptions of the activities that will be assessed during this course. Where applicable, examples are also provided.

*Some of the assessment practices may be unfamiliar to you. For more information on why I grade the way that I do, please see my blog post, ["Why Grade?"](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/07/why-grade/). I am glad to answer any questions you have (the earlier the better) and to entertain proposals for changes or exceptions (again, the earlier the better).*


## Major assignments/deadlines (dates subject to change)

**Week 4:** Fundamentals writing test, attempt 1  
**Week 7:** Fundamentals writing test, attempt 2  
**Week 7:** Final attempts for online fundamentals quizzes  

## Reading/video quizzes (online)

There will be two reading/video assignments most weeks, with online reading quizzes due to be completed by 7am on Tuesday and Thursday. These quizzes will run in D2L. Only quizzes submitted by students present in class will be assessed.

Online quizzes will be open-note, will include mostly informational questions, and will be graded by percentage of questions answered correctly. Most quizzes will contain one or two questions that are created in order to get you thinking about conceptual issues that we will engage during class, and to give me information about everyone's general level of understanding before class. These questions will receive full credit for any honest attempt, regardless of correctness, and will be labeled as "graded for attempt only."

While these quizzes are open-note and collaboration is allowed, I highly encourage you to attempt them individually without consulting readings or notes, and then go back to your notes (and/or your study partner's notes) and correct any mistakes before submitting your answers. This will give you both practice recalling the information and feedback when you are incorrect — two of the most helpful things for memorizing information correctly (and preparing for in-class activities).

The goal for these quizzes is to promote the memorization of basic information that we will be addressing and applying in class, and to promote long-term retention of information engaged in this course. Thus, they must be done regularly and *before* we work through these concepts in class. There are no reassessment opportunities for quizzes. However, the lowest 15% of all quiz grades will be dropped when calculating your final grade. 


## Fundamentals quizzes (online)

Fluency in notational and conceptual fundamentals is absolutely essential to successful musicianship, especially (but not exclusively) for those of us who work primarily in written styles (classical, jazz, liturgical musics). Readings and in-class discussions will help you gain, or shore up, an understanding of these concepts. A series of online quizzes will help you build accuracy and fluency.

During the first half of the semester, there will be online, fast-paced, timed quizzes on the following topics: meter & time signatures, keys & key signatures, pitches (on treble, alto, and bass staves), scales, scale degrees, intervals, triads (lead-sheet chord symbols), seventh chords (lead-sheet chord symbols), and Roman-numeral chord symbols.

Research shows that *repeated*, low-stakes attempts to recall information, spread out over time is one of the best ways to memorize something and remember it for a long time. With that in mind, multiple quizzes will be given for each of these ten topics. You may attempt a quiz for any topic *once per class meeting* (i.e., twice per week), and you can attempt quizzes for as many topics as you like for each class meeting. Your *best two quiz scores* for each topic will count toward your overall grade; all other attempts will be dropped from the grade and simply considered practice. In other words, keep studying for and taking quizzes for a topic until you have two grades you are happy with; then stop taking quizzes for that topic and focus your practice on other topics.

You may be used to classes in which every quiz/homework assignment counts. I believe that unfairly hurts the final grades of students who take longer to master a particular concept or skill. This grading scheme is designed to motivate you to do a lot of practice, to eliminate busy work (no need to take extra quizzes on a topic you've already mastered), to help you identify the specific areas that need the most attention in your studies, and to reflect your *successes* in your final grade, rather than all the steps you took along the way. However, I understand that it may be unfamiliar or even a bit confusing to you, so please talk to me early and often with any questions you have about the grading and how to use the system to best support your growth as a musician.


## Fundamentals test (in-person)

Strong musicians are not simply those who can recognize things when they see or hear them, but those who can also produce them on-demand and write them in a way that is intelligible to other musicians. Class activities will be geared to building this aspect of musical fluency, and that fluency will be assessed with a fundamentals test, tentatively scheduled for Week 5.

The fundamentals test will assess your ability to notate the following things (where applicable, on treble, alto, or bass staves): meter & time signatures, rhythmic notation ("bottom-number transposition"), clefs, keys & key signatures, pitches (on treble, alto, and bass staves), scales, melodic transpositions, intervals, triads, seventh chords, and harmonic labels (lead-sheet chord symbols and Roman-numeral chord symbols). Each of these 11 categories will be scored separately on this test.

There will also be a follow-up test, tentatively scheduled for Week 8. In this test, you may re-attempt any of the topics from the first test for which you are not happy with your result. The best of those two scores for each topic will contribute to the overall course grade.



## Application assignments

Most weeks will involve small-scale assignments in which you will cultivate and/or demonstrate your skills in applying the concepts of the week (and possibly those covered in previous weeks) in a musical task. These will generally be due by the beginning of class. In some weeks there will be two short assignments (one due on Tuesday, one on Thursday), and in other weeks one larger assignment will be due on Tuesday. Submit via the dropbox on the Theory 3 D2L site, unless given different instructions.

These application assignments will include voice-leading exercises, harmonic reductions, harmonic/melodic/formal analyses, composition exercises, etc. For each assignment type, you will be provided with specific instructions and a model assignment to consult as you work. 

## Final writing project

The final unit of the semester explores a very strict style of musical composition, in order to help you understand fundamental principles of how multiple musical voices combine into a whole texture that makes good melodic *and* harmonic sense. However, the "rules" of this strict style only sometimes apply in "real" musical styles. In this final project, find an piece/passage of music that exemplifies these "rules" in action, as well as a piece/passage of music that breaks these rules but still makes good musical sense. Write a short, informal essay or make a short video in which you explain how, specifically, the rules do or do not apply in these musical examples, and explain *why* these passages work the way they do.

More details about this project will be provided later in the semester.
