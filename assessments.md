## Grades (from the syllabus)

The most important and interesting aspects of learning are things that are difficult to assess fairly and reductively (i.e., with a single letter). As a result, heavy emphasis on grades tends to [undermine alternative perspectives](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/) — the exact opposite of what a liberal education should do.

My goal in grading is three-fold: to diminish the significance and the negative impact grades can have on the learning environment, to direct your studies clearly (but flexibly) to specific areas that need attention, and to make sure that grades do carry some meaningful representation of the knowledge and skills you possess and gain by the end of the course.

With that in mind, assessment will be oriented around specific concepts and skills, and in order to facilitate learing, the bulk of the assessments will either allow collaboration or reassessment, if not passed on the first attempt. All assessments within a category will be weighted equally.

I have done my best to keep the assessment simple. However, when questions and confusions inevitably arise, it is your responsibility to talk to me as soon as you can so that we can straighten things out.


### Final grade calculation

Following are assessment types that comprise the final grade:

- **Reading/video quizzes (online)** - 20% of the final grade.  
- **Application assignments** - 80% of the final grade.  

All reading quizzes will receive percentage grades (as they did last semester), and the lowest 20% of quiz grades will be dropped from the final grade. They are due before the beginning of class meetings, and there are no late quizzes accepted.

All application assignments will be graded passed/attempted/not-attempted. A complete, honest attempt gets you half credit; a high-quality exemplar that demonstrates understanding of the concept in question receives full credit. Having 100% mastery of 80% of the concepts is *far better* than 80% mastery of 100% of the concepts. So, essentially, your grade will be determined by the number of concepts and skills you master (like with species counterpoint at the end of last semester), not by the number of nit-picky things you get right on each worksheet. With that in mind, you will have at least two opportunities to demonstrate mastery of each concept/skill before moving on.

Below are a full list of concepts and skills for this course, as well as written and/or video descriptions of the activities that will be assessed during this course. Where applicable, examples are also provided.

*Some of the assessment practices may be unfamiliar to you. For more information on why I grade the way that I do, please see my blog post, ["Why Grade?"](http://kris.shaffermusic.com/2014/07/why-grade/). I am glad to answer any questions you have (the earlier the better) and to entertain proposals for changes or exceptions (again, the earlier the better).*


## Reading/video quizzes (online)

There will be one or two reading/video assignments most weeks, with online reading quizzes due to be completed by 7am on Monday and/or Wednesday. These quizzes will run in D2L.

Online quizzes will be open-note, will include mostly informational questions, and will be graded by percentage of questions answered correctly. Most quizzes will contain one or two questions that are created in order to get you thinking about conceptual issues that we will engage during class, and to give me information about everyone's general level of understanding before class. These questions will receive full credit for any honest attempt, regardless of correctness, and will be labeled as "graded for attempt only."

While these quizzes are open-note and collaboration is allowed, I highly encourage you to attempt them individually without consulting readings or notes, and then go back to your notes (and/or your study partner's notes) and correct any mistakes before submitting your answers. This will give you both practice recalling the information and feedback when you are incorrect — two of the most helpful things for memorizing information correctly (and preparing for in-class activities).

The goal for these quizzes is to promote the memorization of basic information that we will be addressing and applying in class, and to promote long-term retention of information engaged in this course. Thus, they must be done regularly and *before* we work through these concepts in class. There are no reassessment opportunities for quizzes. However, the lowest 15% of all quiz grades will be dropped when calculating your final grade. 


## Application assignments

Most weeks will involve small-scale assignments in which you will cultivate and/or demonstrate your skills in applying the concepts of the week (and possibly those covered in previous weeks) in a musical task. These will generally be due by the beginning of class. In some weeks there will be two short assignments (one due on Monday, one on Wednesday), and in other weeks one larger assignment will be due on Monday. Submit via the dropbox on the class D2L site, unless given different instructions.

As stated above, 

> All application assignments will be graded passed/attempted/not-attempted. A complete, honest attempt gets you half credit; a high-quality exemplar that demonstrates understanding of the concept in question receives full credit. Having 100% mastery of 80% of the concepts is *far better* than 80% mastery of 100% of the concepts. So, essentially, your grade will be determined by the number of concepts and skills you master (like with species counterpoint at the end of last semester), not by the number of nit-picky things you get right on each worksheet. With that in mind, you will have at least two opportunities to demonstrate mastery of each concept/skill before moving on.
