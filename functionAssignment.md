Make a video ***no more than two minutes long*** of yourself explaining the concept of harmonic functions in your own words, using a musical example.

In your video please do the following:

- Provide an accurate definition of *harmonic function* in your own words (do not quote *Open Music Theory* or another theory textbook).  
- Provide an accurate definition of *tonic function* (T) as a concept (that is, what is the essence of the function, not simply a list of the chords that belong to it).  
- Reference an example of tonic function in an actual piece of music.  
- Provide an accurate definition of *predominant function* (PD) as a concept (that is, what is the essence of the function, not simply a list of the chords that belong to it).  
- Reference an example of predominant function in an actual piece of music.  
- Provide an accurate definition of *dominant function* (D) as a concept (that is, what is the essence of the function, not simply a list of the chords that belong to it).  
- Reference an example of dominant function in an actual piece of music.  
- Provide an accurate definition of *functional dissonance* as a concept.  
- Reference an example of a functional dissonance in an actual piece of music.  
- Use at least one applied chord as your example of either T or PD.  
- Use at least one phrase/theme from a piece of music in the classical style (Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, or one of their contemporaries).  
- Do all of the above in two minutes or less. (Videos longer than two minutes will not get credit for this objective. **Videos longer than three minutes will not be assessed.**)

Your grade on the assignment will be the percentage of the above 12 objectives completed in your video. There will be a single reassessment opportunity, **but only for those who submitted the first attempt on time** (or worked out other arrangements with me before the deadline).

Be sure to review both the readings and the class activities/examples from the past few weeks as you prepare this video.

Upload your video to the D2L dropbox. If your score cannot be read legibly on the video, upload a PDF or image file of the musical excerpt you reference.

**Here are three examples you can use as general models (from a course in music cognition, not music theory):**
