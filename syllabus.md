Music is an art. Music is a language. Music is therapy. Music is [a clinical tool](http://www.musictherapy.org). Music is a [weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations). Music is an area of humanistic inquiry. Music is math. Music is neuroscience. Music is communal. Music is deeply personal. Music is [bug spray](http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/13/entertainment/ca-musichurts13). Music is religion. Music is [identity formation](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL3505052W/Music_in_Everyday_Life). Music is culture. Music is psychology.

Music is nearly unparalleled in its ability to engage just about every facet of our lives. Perhaps only language has the same reach into our biology, psychology, individual identity, and social community. Music both frames, and is dependent on, our memory. Music both affects and flows from our emotions. Music both embodies and transcends cultural prejudice. And despite its heavily scientific base, even professional musicians treat it with an air of mystery.

One goal of the music theory course sequence is to demistify musical structure, to help you as current and aspiring professional musicians understand the ways in which a variety of types of music are constructed, and what meanings can be attached to those structures. We will continue that work this semester, building on last semester's work with fundamentals and strict voice-leading, growing in our understanding voice-leading, introducing the basic framework of tonal-harmonic syntax, and concluding with an exploration of large-scale musical form in the context of pop/rock music. 

Equally important ― perhaps even more important ― is the process of digging into music and figuring it out. Analyzing, hacking, breaking, and (maybe) putting back together. So part of our musical exploration will involve me giving you new information and insights, but another big part of our work will involve me taking on a more supporting role as your critical exploration of musical structure takes center stage.

## Starting out

## Required course materials

- [*Open Music Theory*](http://www.openmusictheory.com) (free web access).  
- A web-enabled device that is capable of reading online text, accessing the course website, watching video, listening to Spotify or IMSLP audio, and recording video.  
- An active Google Apps account, using your CU IdentiKey credentials. (You all have this already, we will make a lot of use of it.)  
- An account to [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com) (a free account is fine).  
- Staff paper and a pencil (bring to every class meeting).  

All other required class materials will be posted or linked to on the course site.

## The music

We will begin to focus more intently on specific musical styles this semester. After an initial unit capping our study of strict voice-leading, we will look at classical-era instrumental music on the small scale, and then large-scale structures in pop/rock music of the 1950s to the present.

## Units of study

Unit I (approx. weeks 1–5): Review and strict keyboard-style voice-leading  
Unit II (approx. weeks 6–10): Harmonic syntax & the classical phrase model  
Unit III (approx. weeks 11–15): Pop/rock music & introduction to large-scale musical form  

## Assessment & grades

The most important and interesting aspects of learning are things that are difficult to assess fairly and reductively (i.e., with a single letter). As a result, heavy emphasis on grades tends to [undermine alternative perspectives](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/syllabus-manifesto-critical-approach-classroom-culture/)—the exact opposite of what a liberal education should do.

My goal in grading is three-fold: to diminish the significance and the negative impact grades can have on the learning environment, to direct your studies clearly (but flexibly) to specific areas that need attention, and to make sure that grades do carry some meaningful representation of the knowledge and skills you possess and gain by the end of the course.

With that in mind, assessment will be oriented around specific concepts and skills, and in order to facilitate learing, the bulk of the assessments will either allow collaboration or reassessment, if not passed on the first attempt. All assessments within a category will be weighted equally.

I have done my best to keep the assessment simple. However, when questions and confusions inevitably arise, it is your responsibility to talk to me as soon as you can so that we can straighten things out.

### Final grade calculation

Following are assessment types that comprise the final grade:

- **Reading/video quizzes (online)** - 20% of the final grade.  
- **Application assignments** - 80% of the final grade.  

All reading quizzes will receive percentage grades (as they did last semester), and the lowest 20% of quiz grades will be dropped from the final grade. They are due before the beginning of class meetings, and there are no late quizzes accepted.

All application assignments will be graded passed/attempted/not-attempted. A complete, honest attempt gets you half credit; a high-quality exemplar that demonstrates understanding of the concept in question receives full credit. Having 100% mastery of 80% of the concepts is *far better* than 80% mastery of 100% of the concepts. So, essentially, your grade will be determined by the number of concepts and skills you master (like with species counterpoint at the end of last semester), not by the number of nit-picky things you get right on each worksheet. With that in mind, you will have at least two opportunities to demonstrate mastery of each concept/skill before moving on.

For further details about assessment and grades, including a full list of concepts and skills for this course, please see the [Assessment guide](/assessments/).


## Reaching the instructor

The best ways to reach me during the course are [email](mailto:kris.shaffer@colorado.edu) or simply stopping my my office (MUS N138). Please allow up to two class days for a response, though during the work week, I tend to respond much more quickly than that. Messages sent on Saturday or Sunday will likely not receive a reply until Monday or Tuesday.

During my parental leave (Weeks 1–6), Karin Buer will fill in as instructor. She can be reached via [email](mailto:karin.buer@unco.edu) and will also use N138 for office hours.

Zack Patten will continue as teaching assistant. He can be reached via [email](mailto:zachary.patten@colorado.edu) and will hold office hours in N114.


## Technical support

Students can obtain technical support for the technologies used in class by consulting Lynda.com (accessible via [MyCUInfo](https://fedauth.colorado.edu/idp/Authn/UserPassword)), the [CU OIT student help desk](http://www.colorado.edu/oit/support-training/it-service-center), and/or the instructor.
